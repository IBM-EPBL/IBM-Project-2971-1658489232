## Personal Expense Tracker Application 
### Category: Cloud App Development
In order to help users successfully manage their
spending, this project entails developing a personal
expense tracker application. The user-friendly
programme is designed to allow users to plug in
their expenses and visualise them so they can keep
tabs on their spending. A user may also set a
spending budget, and if this budget is exceeded, the user
will receive an email notification.
